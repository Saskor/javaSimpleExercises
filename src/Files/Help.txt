This is the controller for the
Arduino Due Arbitrary
Waveform Generator.
New arbitrary waves can be drawn,
edited, saved, opened and uploaded to the
Arduino Due,
connected via the USB port. A "stepped" wave
feature
allows any number of sharp steps in the wave to
be easily produced if desired. Additionally,
the output can
be switched to sinewave or triangle / sawtooth
instead.
